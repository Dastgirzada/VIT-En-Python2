The year-end average will be calculated by adding 40% of the Midterm grade to 60% of the Final grade. If the average is below 50, \"FAILED\" will be displayed on the screen; if it is 50 or above, \"PASSED\" will be displayed. This printing process will be done for all 4 courses and the courses will be listed one below the other."
